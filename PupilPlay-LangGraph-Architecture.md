# PupilPlay Game Engine - LangGraph Two-Node Architecture

## Overview: Configuration-Driven Gaming with Static Workflow

Following the proven automation engine pattern, PupilPlay uses a **static two-node LangGraph architecture** where all business logic lives in configuration files, not code. This creates an incredibly powerful and flexible system that can adapt to any educational context while maintaining consistent core functionality.

## 🎯 **Core Architecture Philosophy**

### **Static Workflow, Dynamic Behavior**
- **Immutable Graph Structure**: The two-node workflow NEVER changes
- **Configuration-Driven Logic**: All game mechanics, educational content, and AI behavior defined in YAML
- **Universal Adaptability**: Same engine powers math games, language arts, science labs, and multiplayer competitions

### **Two-Node Simplicity**
Following the automation engine's "Keep LangGraph Simple" principle:
- **No Custom Routing Logic**: Use LangGraph's built-in `tools_condition`
- **LLM-Driven Decisions**: Let Gemini decide when to trigger game actions
- **Consistent Error Patterns**: Same fallback mechanisms across all game types

## 🏗️ **Game Engine Workflow Architecture**

```python
class PupilPlayGameEngine:
    def build_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
        """Build the universal two-node game workflow"""
        builder = StateGraph(GameState)

        # Two universal nodes for ALL game types
        builder.add_node("game_master", self._game_master_node)
        builder.add_node("game_actions", self._game_actions_node)

        # Static routing pattern (NEVER changes)
        builder.add_edge(START, "game_master")
        builder.add_conditional_edges("game_master", game_actions_condition)
        builder.add_edge("game_actions", "game_master")

        return builder
```

### **Why This Architecture is Brilliant for Games**

1. **Universal Game Engine**: Same code runs math runners, word puzzles, chemistry labs, and multiplayer battles
2. **Hot-Swappable Content**: Change entire game mechanics by swapping YAML files
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare educational approaches without code changes
4. **Rapid Prototyping**: New game concepts in minutes, not months
5. **AI-First Design**: Intelligence built into every decision point

## 🎮 **Node 1: Game Master (Educational AI Assistant)**

### **Core Function**: *The Socratic Tutor in the Game*

The Game Master is like having a brilliant teacher embedded in every game interaction:

```python
def _game_master_node(self, state: GameState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Create game-specific system prompt from configuration
    system_prompt = self._create_educational_system_prompt(state)

    # Select Gemini model based on educational complexity
    # Flash: Quick feedback, simple hints, routine interactions
    # Pro: Complex explanations, detailed analysis, creative content
    llm = self._select_gemini_model_for_education(state)

    # Bind available game actions to LLM
    if self.game_actions:
        llm = llm.bind_tools(self.game_actions)

    # Process player interaction with full educational context
    messages = [SystemMessage(content=system_prompt)] + state["messages"]
    response = llm.invoke(messages, config)

    return {
        "messages": [response],
        "learning_turn_count": state.get("learning_turn_count", 0) + 1,
        "educational_complexity": self._assess_learning_complexity(response),
        "engagement_score": self._calculate_engagement(state, response)
    }
```

### **Game Master Responsibilities**

#### 🧠 **Educational Intelligence**
- **Adaptive Tutoring**: Real-time assessment of player understanding
- **Socratic Questioning**: Guide discovery through strategic questions
- **Misconception Detection**: Identify and address learning gaps immediately
- **Personalized Explanations**: Adapt teaching style to individual learner needs

#### 🎯 **Game Flow Management**
- **Narrative Progression**: Maintain engaging storylines tied to learning objectives

- **Assessment Integration**: Continuous evaluation without disrupting gameplay

### **System Prompt as Educational Philosophy Container**

All teaching strategies, subject expertise, and pedagogical approaches live in the system prompt:

```yaml
# Example: Math Runner System Prompt Configuration
system_prompt_template: |
  You are an expert mathematics educator embedded in an endless runner game called "Multiplication Masters."

  Your primary role is to help students aged 8-12 master multiplication facts through engaging gameplay.

  EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY:
  - Use Socratic questioning to guide discovery, never just give answers
  - Celebrate every attempt and effort, not just correct answers
  - Connect abstract math concepts to concrete, visual representations
  - Maintain optimal challenge level: 80% success rate for confidence building
  - Provide immediate, specific feedback on mathematical reasoning

  GAME CONTEXT:
  - Player is {player_name}, currently at level {current_level}
  - Recent performance: {accuracy_rate}% accuracy, {problems_per_minute} problems/minute
  - Learning gaps: {identified_gaps}
  - Current multiplication focus: {target_tables}

  AVAILABLE GAME ACTIONS:
  - adjust_difficulty: Change problem complexity in real-time
  - generate_hint: Provide visual or conceptual hint
  - create_problem: Generate new multiplication challenge
  - update_progress: Track mastery of specific multiplication facts
  - trigger_celebration: Initiate success animation and positive reinforcement

  COMMUNICATION STYLE:
  - Enthusiastic but not overwhelming
  - Age-appropriate vocabulary (8-12 years old)
  - Focus on mathematical thinking process, not just answers
  - Use game metaphors: "mathematical powers," "number magic," "calculation spells"

  Remember: Every interaction should build both mathematical understanding AND confidence!
```

## ⚡ **Node 2: Game Actions (Real-World Integration Hub)**

### **Core Function**: *The Bridge Between AI Decisions and Game Reality*

Game Actions execute the Game Master's intelligent decisions in the real game world:

```python

    # Same pattern as automation engine's tools node
    if not self.game_actions:
