## Two-Node Architecture: The Heart of PupilPlay

### 🎯 **Static Workflow, Dynamic Intelligence**

Following the automation engine's proven pattern, PupilPlay uses an **immutable two-node LangGraph structure**:

1. **Game Master Node**: Educational AI tutor (replaces Assistant Node)
2. **Game Actions Node**: Execution hub (replaces Tools Node) 
3. **LangGraph's `tools_condition`**: Built-in routing (no custom logic needed)

### 🏗️ **Why This Architecture is Revolutionary for Educational Gaming**

#### **Universal Game Engine**
- **Single Codebase**: Same two nodes power math runners, word puzzles, chemistry labs, and multiplayer battles
- **Hot-Swappable Logic**: Change entire game mechanics by swapping YAML configuration files
- **Infinite Scalability**: Add new subjects, age groups, and game types without touching code

#### **Configuration-Over-Code Philosophy**
All game intelligence lives in the **system prompt template** (loaded from YAML):

```python
# ALL educational logic is configuration-driven
system_prompt = config.system_prompt_template.format(
    subject=config.subject,
    game_type=config.game_type,
    player_age=player.age,
    learning_gaps=player.identified_gaps,
    available_tools=", ".join(available_game_actions)
)
```

## 🧠 **Node 1: Game Master (Educational AI Tutor)**

### **Core Responsibilities**
- **Socratic Teaching**: Guide discovery through strategic questioning
- **Adaptive Tutoring**: Real-time assessment and personalized support
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Encourage persistence and celebrate progress
- **Curriculum Alignment**: Ensure all interactions support learning objectives

### **Gemini Model Selection** (Same as Automation Engine)
```python
def select_educational_model(complexity_score: float) -> ChatGoogleGenerativeAI:
    if complexity_score >= 0.6:  # Complex explanations, creative content
        return gemini_pro_with_circuit_breaker()
    else:  # Quick feedback, routine interactions  
        return gemini_flash_with_circuit_breaker()
```

### **Educational System Prompt Structure**
Every subject gets specialized prompts loaded from configuration:

```yaml
# Math Game Master Configuration
system_prompt_template: |
  You are an expert mathematics educator embedded in "{game_name}".
  
  EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:
  - Student: {player_name}, age {player_age}
  - Subject: {subject}, Topic: {current_topic}
  - Learning Gaps: {identified_gaps}
  - Current Performance: {recent_accuracy}% accuracy
  
  AVAILABLE GAME ACTIONS:
  {available_game_actions}
  
  TEACHING PHILOSOPHY:
  - Use Socratic questioning to guide discovery
  - Celebrate effort and progress, not just correct answers
  - Provide hints that guide thinking, never direct answers
  - Maintain 80% success rate for confidence building
```

## ⚡ **Node 2: Game Actions (Execution Hub)**
